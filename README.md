# Azure Data Factory COVID-19 Reporting

### Concept of the Project ðŸ’¡
- This undertaking involves the acquisition of several Covid-19 Datasets from the ECDC website. These datasets are subsequently processed through diverse ADF components to effect transformations. These transformations are executed using ADF, HDInsight, and Databricks. The resultant data is then loaded into SQL Datawarehouse with the intention of enabling the Analytics team to draw meaningful and practical insights from these datasets. The primary objective is to comprehensively understand the influence of Covid on the entirety of the European Region throughout the course of the year 2020.
