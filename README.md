# Azure Data Factory COVID-19 Reporting

### Concept of the Project 💡
- This project involves the acquisition of several Covid-19 Datasets from the ECDC website. These datasets are subsequently processed through diverse ADF components to effect transformations. These transformations are executed using ADF, HDInsight, and Databricks. The resultant data is then loaded into SQL Datawarehouse with the intention of enabling the Analytics team to draw meaningful and practical insights from these datasets. The primary objective is to comprehensively understand the influence of Covid on the entirety of the European Region throughout the course of the year 2020.

### Task 
- This project's mission is to ingest data from multiple data sources, clean it up, and alter it so that it is more robust and suitable for the goal. Once the data has been cleaned, it should be imported into a central repository, such as a data warehouse or datalake, so that the analytics team can utilize Power BI and other BI tools to access it. The data warehouse will contain information on confirmed cases, regrettable death rates, hospitalization and ICU cases from our weekly data lake counts, as well as testing statistics. Additionally, we can utilize these data to construct ML Models that forecast the spread of COVID in the European region.

### Source Data:
- ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19)
- Population Data From Azure Blob Storage (eurostat_data)
